Zhongjie Wang is a Senior Software Engineer specializing in Networking at NVIDIA. Prior to joining NVIDIA, he was a Senior Security Researcher at Baidu USA. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside, where he was advised by Professor [Zhiyun Qian](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhiyunq/) and Professor [Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~krish/). He holds a bachelor's degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and a master's degree from Peking University. 

His research interests include network security, program analysis, formal verification, censorship, and privacy. He is particularly focused on developing automated tools to enhance software security and identify vulnerabilities.

Previously, he worked as a software testing engineer at NetEase Games. He also held internships at several prominent companies and institutions, including Microsoft Research Asia, Morgan Stanley, Samsung Research America, and the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at Berkeley.
