Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a predominant
substitute of the current TCP/IP networking and it is proposed to
be the next generation Internet foundation. The evident
characteristic of this network architecture is caching and
indexing contents by the inner nodes – the routers, so as to reduce
the redundant transmission and thereby shorten the distance
between user and content. In this paper, we propose and
implement a user authentication scheme over CCN. We adopt the
trust model based on certificate authority (CA) to provide the
service of binding certificate with user’s identity, and help user
determine the authenticity and reliability of the publisher of the
network content. Also the specialized CA we designed for CCN
takes advantage of the decentralization characteristic and cache
mechanism of CCN to distribute the certificates and certificate
revocation list (CRL) into the network, and it reduces the load of
the CA central server when retrieving and verifying certificates.
Besides, we propose a timeline-based method to segment the CRL
with certificate issue date, thereby making the retrieval of CRL
more effective.
